         * Introduction To Programming Languages:->

                  A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs. 

              Some of the key features of programming languages include:




           1) Syntax: The specific rules and structure used to write code in a programming language.


           2) Data Types: The type of values that can be stored in a program, such as numbers, strings, and booleans.


           3) Variables: Named memory locations that can store values.


           4) Operators: Symbols used to perform operations on values, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.


           5) Control Structures: Statements used to control the flow of a program, such as if-else statements, loops, and function calls.


           6) Libraries and Frameworks: Collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks and speed up development.


           7) Paradigms: The programming style or philosophy used in the language, such as procedural, object-oriented, or functional.



      * Basic Terminologies  in Programming Languages:

          1) Algorithm:-> A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.

          2) Variable:-> A named storage location in memory that holds a value or data.

          3) Data Type:-> A classification that specifies what type of data a variable can hold, such as integer, string, or boolean.

          4) Function:-> A self-contained block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.

          5) Control Flow:-> The order in which statements are executed in a program, including loops and conditional statements.

          6) Syntax:-> The set of rules that govern the structure and format of a programming language.

          7) Comment:-> A piece of text in a program that is ignored by the compiler or interpreter, used to 

             add notes or explanations to the code.

          8) Debugging:-> The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.


          9) Operator: A symbol or keyword that represents an action or operation to be performed on one or more 

             values or variables, such as + (addition), â€“ (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).

         10) Statement: A single line or instruction in a program that performs a specific action or operation.
